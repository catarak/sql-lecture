Navicat premium - database type agnostic

CRUD:
CREATE - INSERT
RETRIEVE - SELECT
UPDATE - UPDATE
DELETE

* Create backup
$ cp blog-engine.sql blog-engine.backup

* Null comparison
id IS NULL, not id = NULL

* When would you use an outer join?
I'm still not sure.

* To use sqlite3 with ruby, need a gem!
